CommonwealthU Graphics 480 Final Project - created with WebGL (no additional frameworks/libraries)

The scene contains a landscape, explorable using keyboard controls or by allowing the camera to follow a pre-defined loop across the terrain. The terrain mesh
was generated from a height map of part of the Grand Canyon, Arizona USA.

Contains examples of the following techniques
- Phong lighting model
- Skybox (using a texture)
- Keyboard controls of camera
- Pre-defined camera path
- Level one Ray-tracing (Skybox reflected in water)
- Procedural generation of terrain features (rocks, grass, trees)
